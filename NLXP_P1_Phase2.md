*Prompt:*
Given in the “prompt_task_2.md”. 

*Reasoning:*

3. Question-Answering: The model will be assessed based on a specific prompt and its accuracy in answering the question. A dataset containing 5 Q & A with the exact verifiable prognosis/ treatment/ procedure would be made to assess the model’s domain knowledge and specificity. MedQA is a dataset that would be used for evaluation.
