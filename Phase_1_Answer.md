**Phase 1: Foundation Building**

**1. Domain Selection:**
The domain selected by me would be related to Healthcare and the contribution of AI in the given domain would be evaluated in my current phase. Healthcare as a sector currently is undergoing rapid transformation due to the current AI model integration and testing/ evaluating their capabilities is an important criterion. Evaluation of the proprietary and open source model is still ongoing and not a lot of research has been done on the same.

**2. Task Definition:**
For the given assignment, I would be taking up the following tasks to evaluate the capabilities of each AI model:

- *Classification/Analysis:* Categorizing or evaluating complex information from transcript and correctly giving the ICD, CPT and HCPCS code for the same.

- *Generation/Creation:* Producing healthcare related content from these clinical notes/ knowledge sources for the LLM to summarize to the patient, as to symptoms, diagnosis and the procedure done to treat it.

- *Question-Answering:* Responding to such user inquiries with at least 80% accuracy which aligns with the given disease/ procedure/ terminology.


**3. Success Criteria:**
For the given assignment, 3 models would be tested and evaluated for accuracy, relevance, completeness and domain appropriateness.

The 3 models being evaluated are as follows:

- Proprietary Advanced: Gemini 2.5 Pro by Google 
- Proprietary Standard: ChatGPT-4o by OpenAI 
- Open Source: MedGemma 27B by Google Deepmind 

The reasoning for choosing these 3 models are as follows:

**Gemini 2.5 Pro:** 
Is the SOTA paid model from Google that can be used by users and is extremely capable of Q & A and other tasks as it can also search webpages to verify its output.
The given model was developed by Google and will be a good comparison model with MedGemma, which is domain specific to analyze the difference in their responses.

**ChatGPT 4o:**
SOTA model of OpenAI, a go to model that is known by everyone around the world and dominating in terms of popularity. A good model to evaluate especially to assess the model’s healthcare domain expertise and to assess the relevancy of the model’s domain knowledge.

**MedGemma 27B:**
A domain specific Gemma3 model trained on multiple healthcare related data and having the capabilities to evaluate and also give relevant domain knowledge. Made by Google’s Deepmind team for healthcare related tasks. 

**Evaluation Criteria:**
The given models will be evaluated by using the given methodologies:

- *Classification/Analysis:* Categorizing or evaluating complex information from transcript and correctly giving the ICD, CPT and HCPCS code for the same.

- *Generation/ Creation:* The model will be assessed based on how well the model summarizes the text based on 2 categories (patient facing and clinician facing). The given will be rated on Likert Scale (0-5) of agreement or disagreement with the response/ summarization done by the given AI model.

- *Question-Answering:* The model will be assessed based on a specific prompt and its accuracy in answering the question. A dataset containing 10 Q & A with the exact verifiable prognosis/ treatment/ procedure would be made to assess the model’s domain knowledge and specificity. MedQA is a dataset that would be used.
  
The given would be how the study would be conducted regarding each of the LLM Model’s capabilities.
