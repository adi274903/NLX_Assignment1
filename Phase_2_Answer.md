**Phase 2: Prompt Engineering Mastery**

The following are the prompts used per task:

1. Classification/Analysis:

Categorizing or evaluating complex information from transcript and correctly giving the ICD, CPT and HCPCS code for the same.

- CLEAR PROMPT: 

*Prompt:*


*Reasoning:* 
The given prompt is based

- Few-Shot PROMPT:

*Prompt:*


*Reasoning:* 
The given prompt is based

- Chain-of-Thought PROMPT:

*Prompt:*


*Reasoning:* 
The given prompt is based


2. Generation/ Creation:

The model will be assessed based on how well the model summarizes the text based on 2 categories (patient facing and clinician facing).

- CLEAR PROMPT: 

*Prompt:*


*Reasoning:* 
The given prompt is based

- Few-Shot PROMPT:

*Prompt:*


*Reasoning:* 
The given prompt is based

- Chain-of-Thought PROMPT:

*Prompt:*


*Reasoning:* 
The given prompt is based



3. Question-Answering:

The model will be assessed based on a specific prompt and its accuracy in answering the question. A dataset containing 5 Q & A with the exact verifiable prognosis/ treatment/ procedure would be made to assess the modelâ€™s domain knowledge and specificity. MedQA is a dataset that would be used for evaluation.
